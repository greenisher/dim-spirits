description = "A talisman in the shape of a hammer, traditionally worn by apprentices of the smith's guild. The tenets of the guild are stamped into the iron: Creation and Transformation both have their place at the anvil.

The final apprentice had no masters left to stop her. She has changed their tenets to read: Creation and destruction under the hammer. This badge precedes her and retains the original words."
