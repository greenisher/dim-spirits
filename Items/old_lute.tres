description = "A reminder of a time before Luteberg was lost, when music rang out on every street. Despite its lonely air, the strumming of it makes you happy.

Before destruction came, Luteberg was ruled by a council of guild masters. First among them was the musician's guild. Now only one of the old masters remains."
